# Tommy's assessment center

Today we write a test. I dont want to punish you, the school wants a asssesment about the state everybody is. Some tasks are pretty hard - show me that you've tryed at least. It will have no consequenses - so no marks or so. Just give the best you can <3

We want to copy the node.js meetup page for a event i've been recently
[Here is the example.](https://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Meetup-Berlin/events/242217963/?eventId=242217963)


## How to start:
open `assets/javascripts/index.js`



#### READ CAREFULLY! - work autonomously - provide for each task 1 commit, try to use the class-based aproach

## Tasks:
1. In `index.js:124` there is a bug in the for loop. Fix it.
2. The attendees list looks shit, make it look like on the original meetup page. (round image, text below the image, add the role of the attendee (member or organizer) also with javascript)
3. Make the more button work (Tipp: you just have to remove 1 class with javascript from .preview)
4. Fill all XXX with stuff from the data object (use different types of DOM selectors)
5. The upper part with the Eventinfo between the navbar and the details section looks good, but the details section has a differnt column arrangement(6-6). make the columns as above: 8-4 so that they match in vertical alignment
6. make the navigation bar fixed. Use 1 bootstrap class or do it in css
7. The text of the details is just placeholder content. Fill it with the text from the data object. Advanced Solution would be with keeping the \n\r acting like a newline/return. DuckDuckGo for "innerText"
8. The searchbar at the top should be required, the placeholder should be "search" and I want to have the value which is currently typed in logged in the console when I press the button (provide a selector in the elements, create a eventlistener for the searchbutton, run this eventlistener once in the constructor)
9. In line 132 the function argument has "a = {}" inside, what does that mean? Make a comment above line 132
10. If you struggle with the hard tasks, just make it visually more attractive
11. Provide a few comments in the code to show that you got it. If you find bugs - fix them
12. Push your code to github
